Measurement,Base quantities,Base quantities are quantities that can be accurately and easily reproduced and are unchanging with time.
Measurement,Derived quantities,Derived quantities are quantities that are obtained from the multiplication or division of base quantities.
Measurement,Homogeneous equation,Any equation where each term has the same base units is said to be homogeneous. 
Measurement,Systematic error,"A systematic error will result in all readings being either above or below the accepted value. The error may be reduced by improving the experimental techniques, or making corrections for it if its cause is known."
Measurement,Random error ,A random error will result in readings being scattered around the accepted value. The error may be reduced by taking the mean of several measurements or by plotting a graph and drawing a best-fit line. 
Measurement,Accuracy,The accuracy of an experiment is a measure of how close the experimental result is to the true value or accepted value. Accuracy depends on how well we can control or compensate for the systematic errors. Accurate measurement has a small systematic error.
Measurement,Precision,The precision of an experiment is a measure of how exactly the experimental result is determined. It is also a measure of how close the experimental results are to each other. Precision depends on how well we can reduce the random errors. Precise measurement has a small random error.

Forces,Equilibrium,An object is said to be in equilibrium if the resultant force acting on it is zero and the resultant torque acting on the object about every point is zero.
Forces,Stable equilibrium,An object is in stable equilibrium if it returns to its original position after it has been displaced slightly. 
Forces,Unstable equilibrium,An object is in unstable equilibrium if any displacement from its original position lowers its centre of gravity. Toppling occurs when the centre of gravity of an object falls outside its base. 
Forces,Conditions for equilibrium,(i)   The sum of the forces in any direction must be zero.
