    question: "A car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at 2.0 m/s² for 10 seconds. What is the final velocity of the car?",
    correctAnswer: 20,
    unit: "m/s",
    equation: "v = u + at",
    explanation: "Using v = u + at, where u = 0 (starts from rest), a = 2.0 m/s², and t = 10 s, we get v = 0 + 2.0*10 = 20 m/s."

    correctAnswer: 30,
    unit: "m/s",
    equation: "v = u + at",
    explanation: "Using v = u + at, where u = 15 m/s, a = 3.0 m/s², and t = 5.0 s, we get v = 15 + 3.0*5.0 = 30 m/s."

    correctAnswer: -5.0,
    unit: "m/s²",
    equation: "v = u + at",
    explanation: "Using v = u + at, where v = 0 (stops), u = 20 m/s, and t = 4.0 s, we get 0 = 20 + a*4.0 => a = -5.0 m/s²."

    correctAnswer: 5.0,
    unit: "m",
    equation: "v² = u² + 2as",
    explanation: "Using v² = u² + 2as, where v = 0 (at max height), u = 10 m/s, a = -10 m/s², we get 0 = 10² + 2*(-10)*s => s = 5.0 m."

    equation: "v² = u² + 2as",
    explanation: "Using v² = u² + 2as, where v = 25 m/s, u = 5.0 m/s, and s = 150 m, we get 25² = 5.0² + 2*a*150 => a = 2.0 m/s²."

    equation: "v² = u² + 2as",
    explanation: "Using v² = u² + 2as, where v = 0 (stops), u = 10 m/s, and s = 20 m, we get 0 = 10² + 2*a*20 => a = -2.5 m/s²."

    correctAnswer: 16,
    unit: "m",
    equation: "s = ut + 0.5at²",
    explanation: "Using s = ut + 0.5at², where u = 0 (starts from rest), a = 2.0 m/s² (from v = u + at), and t = 4.0 s, we get s = 0 + 0.5*2.0*4.0² = 16 m."

    question: "A train moving with a constant acceleration covers 400 meters in 20 seconds. If its initial velocity is 10 m/s, what is its acceleration?",
    correctAnswer: 1.0,
    unit: "m/s²",
    equation: "s = ut + 0.5at²",
    explanation: "Using s = ut + 0.5at², where s = 400 m, u = 10 m/s, and t = 20 s, we get 400 = 10*20 + 0.5*a*20² => a = 1.0 m/s²."

    correctAnswer: 100,
    unit: "m",
    equation: "s = ut + 0.5at²",
    explanation: "Using s = ut + 0.5at² for deceleration, where u = 20 m/s, a = -2.0 m/s² (from v = u + at), and t = 10 s, we get s = 20*10 + 0.5*(-2.0)*10² = 100 m."
